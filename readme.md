This is the github user list example from https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754.

It's been rewritten in typescript, and it uses webpack and yarn.

Clone it, run yarn to install dependencies, and in the console write "npm run start".

To install yarn, it's "npm install --save-dev yarn".
